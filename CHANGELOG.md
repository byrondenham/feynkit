# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-19

### Breaking changes

- Python 3.10 or newer is required. Python 3.9 reached end of life in October 2025.
- The `method` keyword has been removed from `is_affinely_equivalent`,
  `is_point_config_equivalent` and `FeynmanIntegral.is_affinely_equivalent_to`.
  The `"sage"` option it accepted was a placeholder that ran the SymPy search anyway.

### Added

- `feynkit.algebra.ideal_quotient` and `feynkit.algebra.intersect_ideals`, computed
  by elimination.
- `feynkit.algebra.compute_syzygy_module`, which returns generators of the first
  syzygy module via Buchberger's algorithm with cofactor tracking.
- `SchwingerParametrisation.dehomogenised_symanzik_polynomials` and
  `SchwingerParametrisation.get_A_matrix`, giving the GKZ form of the Schwinger
  representation.
- `reduce_polynomial` and `is_in_ideal` accept an `order` argument so the reduction
  can match the monomial order of the supplied Gröbner basis.
- `feynkit.io.latex.to_latex_split` now splits long expressions at top-level
  plus and minus signs instead of returning them unchanged.
- A GitHub Actions workflow runs the test suite on Python 3.10 and 3.14 and the
  full pre-commit hook set.
- Tests for the database, the `fk` command line, the section exporters and the
  3D geometry helpers.

### Fixed

- `import feynkit` failed on Python 3.13 and earlier because of an invalid
  annotation in the Schwinger module.
- The SQLite toric-ideal cache raised an `IndexError` on every hit, so results
  were never reused.
- `FeynkitDatabase.find_equivalent` computed the toric ideal of the query
  integral without using it.
- An undefined name in `examples/higher_analogues_search.py`.

### Removed

- The Sphinx configuration entries and the readthedocs URL. `docs/guide.md` is the
  documentation.
- Saved CLI output files from the repository root.
- Unreachable planar-polytope code in `feynkit.visualisation.geometry`.
